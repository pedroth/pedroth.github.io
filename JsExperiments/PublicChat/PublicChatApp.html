Simple Public Chat web application where everyone can write without having to login.
The only security feature this site has is a clear button that clears everything from the server.<br>
You can also upload files to server up to 500 MB.<br>
The link to git code is available in the Public Chat web page.<br>
In future updates I will try to add the https protocol. The server is sometimes off :).
