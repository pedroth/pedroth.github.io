Eigen Simulation App is a application that lets you visualize three algorithms for finding eigenvectors. For starters eigenvectors are vectors that have the following property: <br>
    let $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ be a matrix and $\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ a vector then $\mathbf{v}$ is a not trivial solution ( that means $\mathbf{v} \neq \mathbf{0}$) of the equation below:

    $$A\mathbf{v} = \lambda \mathbf{v}\;\;\;(1)$$

    These eigenvectors and eigenvalues (the $\lambda$ 's in (1)) are very useful for different applications like Physics, Optimization, Machine Learning, etc.
    Here I explore such methods in a visual matter. I tried three methods, the first is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_iteration">power method</a> and the other two are based a constraint optimization problem. <br>
    A small detail I forgot to mention is that the matrix $A$ is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_matrix">symmetric matrix</a> (this is important because it guarantees the existence of real eigenvectors and eigenvalues).<br>
    The optimization problem is the following :
    $$\min_{\mathbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^n} \text{ or } \max_{\mathbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^n} \left < \mathbf{x}, A \mathbf{x}\right >$$
    $$\text{such that  } \;\;|\mathbf{x}|^2 = 1 \;\;\; (2)$$

    In the application you will see a sphere (which by the way is the space of the constraint in (2)) and in this sphere there is a color. This color represent the value of the cost function in (2). <br>
    By clicking on [3] you will be able to see the gradient vector field of this cost function on the sphere.<br>
