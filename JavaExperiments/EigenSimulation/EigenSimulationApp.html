Eigen Simulation App is a application that visualize three algorithms of finding eigenvectors. For starters eigenvectors are vectors that have the following property: <br>
    let $A \in \mathbbb{R}^{n \times n}$ and $\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ then $\mathbf{v}$ is a not trivial solution ( that means $\mathbf{v} \neq \mathbf{0}$) of :

    $$A\mathbf{v} = \lambda \mathbf{v}\;\;\;(1)$$

    These eigenvectors and eigenvalues (the $\lambda$ 's in (1)) are very useful for different applications like Physics, Optimization, Machine Learning, etc.
    Here I explore methods to find eigenvectors. I tried three methods, the first is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_iteration">power method</a> and the other two are based in the next constraint optimization problem :
    A small detail I forgot to tell is that the matrix $A$ is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_matrix">symmetric</a> (this is important because it gives guarantees about the existence of real eigenvectors and eigenvalues).
    $$\min_{\mathbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^n} \left < \mathbf{x}, A \mathbf{x}\right >$$
    $$\text{s.t  } \;\;|\mathbf{x}|^2 = 1 \;\;\; (2)$$
