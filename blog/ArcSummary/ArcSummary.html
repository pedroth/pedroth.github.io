                This blog entry redirects you two my masters thesis about "Arc Summaries of TV Series".
                Although I couldn't have nice results, in the paper there are a good description of the algorithms that were developed/used for segmentation, clustering and summarization of text signals.
                In the paper we used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_graph_theory">Spectral Graph Theory</a> framework to solve most of the problems, relating this area with glimpses of other fields such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_exterior_calculus">Discrete Exterior Calculus</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_data_analysis">Functional Data Analysis</a>.

                <h2> Abstract </h2>

                In this dissertation, we aim to create a system capable of generating summaries of arcs
                of TV series. With thousands of hours of video being uploaded and stored in video-sharing
                websites and online streaming services, a need for video summarization appears as a necessary
                tool to save time and catch up with our beloved series. We propose a way to solve this problem
                using just subtitles information. The presented solution uses the framework of spectral graph
                theory to segment, find story arcs and summarize those arcs.<br><br>
