IntuitionOfCalculus; 31/05/2014; Intuition Of Calculus; A post explaining the basics of differential and integral calculus from the perspective of someone who is trying to solve problems.
TaylorPolynomial; 05/06/2014; Taylor Polynomial; A fundamental concept in calculus is the Taylor polynomial, which solves many questions in Optimization, Analysis and Differential Equations. In this post I will sketch how someone could have found it using simple calculus.
ProjectionDotProduct; 05/07/2014; Projection and Dot product; In this post we will study a fundamental operation on vectors (and functions cough cough!), using a geometric and variational approach.
DiscreteCalculusP1; 25/10/2014; Discrete Calculus I; As a computer scientist I work always with the discrete domains, hence I decided to study sequence of numbers using a discrete calculus approach.
DiscreteCalculusP2; 28/10/2014; Discrete Calculus II; This post is a continuation of the previous post where we tried to find a discrete calculus.
ODEMatrixExponential; 16/03/2015; Matrix Exponential; Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is an amazing field, where we explore a way of solving linear ODEs.
GradientJacobianHessian; 18/07/2015; Gradient,Jacobian and Hessian; In an earlier post we talked about the intuition of calculus in one dimension, here we will expand this intuition by adding functions with multiple variables. This subject is very interesting since most of the problems have multiple variables. It will open the path to amazing connections between analysis and geometry!!!
OptimizationI; 14/11/2015; Optimization I; An amazing topic to talk about since many problems can described in this language. Also this area of optimization theory have found many interesting algorithms and formulas to solve such problems. Imagine someday where you can describe a problem (optimization one) to a computer and a computer already knows how to solve it (by using optimization algorithms). We will start this optimization series with the basics of optimization.
ProofGreenTheorem; 02/08/2016; My Proof of Green's Theorem; Never liked proofs given to me about Green's Theorem, in a sentence this theorem computes global things about a domain using just information of its boundary. Such theorem has infinite applications in physics, optimization, differential geometry, complex analysis, etc. In this post I sketch a satisfying proof (at least for me) of this significant theorem.
ArcSummary; 24/11/2017 ; Arc Summary ;Presents a paper that tries to solve the problem of summarization of arcs of tv series. The paper goes deep on the algorithms of text segmentation, clustering and summarization.
