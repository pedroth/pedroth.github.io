After working on the [Ray-Tracing Demo][ray-trace], I wanted to take things further and create a simple game. That’s how Hyper Match 3D was born(more of a demo, really). It uses much of the same technology, and in the process, helped refine both [tela.js][tela] and the [Ray-Tracing Demo][ray-trace] itself.
