Simple Public Chat web application where everyone can write without having to login.

<ul>
    <li>
        The only security feature this site has is a clear button that clears everything from the server.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can also upload files to server up to 500 MB.
    </li>
    <li>
        The link to git code is available in the Public Chat web page.
    </li>
</ul>

In future updates I will try to add the https protocol. The server is sometimes off :).
