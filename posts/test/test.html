          In this post we found out a discrete calculus. While doing it, we
          discovered the discrete analogs of the fundamental theorem of
          calculus, the Taylor polynomial, and the exponential function. We also
          saw how the Newton series could be applied to interpolation and to
          derive the continuous Taylor polynomial, which let me think about this
          calculus being a more fundamental tool, than its continuous
          counterpart. In future posts, I would like to continue this adventure
          on discrete calculus, by exploring a multivariate discrete calculus,
          discrete differential geometry and so on.
