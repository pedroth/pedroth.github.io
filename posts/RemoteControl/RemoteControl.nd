Remote control is a simple project I made to control my raspberry pi from my cell phone it turns out to be a failure, but it still works to control my computer from my cell phone.

## Implementation details

Most of the program was `vibe coded`. I used `vscode`, `gemini3`, and `chatgpt`. After a few iterations, it was able to produce an initial prototype. The good part was that it got the main architecture right: WebSocket communication, the _libs_ for controlling the keyboard and mouse, and even some of the more challenging mouse control logic. 

The downside was that it required a lot of manual fixing, testing, and debugging to get it right. It also created some redundant files and dependencies, in general, it was not a minimal codebase as I asked. The codebase ended up being quite unmaintainable (for me, at least). In the end, I mostly rewrote everything on top of the original prototype.

Overall, it was a good experience, and I don’t think I could have done it without the help of AI (or at least it would have taken me much longer).
